- here, routines are "exercises"
- exercises ARE NOT study materials
- you do "exercises" everyday if you have time to spare
- "exercises" are use for "daily execution" to remove skill decay, achieve mastery, and job interview preparedness
- "exercises" for job interview preparedness "anytime anywhere"
- exercise has a "contained" specific goal 
- exercise may have "steps" to finish the said exercise
- pervious exercise should mostly prepare you for the next exercise
- exercise are arrange from top the easiest to hardest at the bottom
- "futured decayed self" is expected to slowly repeat an exercise and proceed to the next if skill/knowledge and time are ready
- improve and insert more exercise as time goes on
